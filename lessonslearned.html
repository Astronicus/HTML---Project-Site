    <h1>What lessons did you learn from the project?</h1>
    <p>
      One of the things we learned was that we definitely had to work better on our time management. Even though it's expected
      that we would prioritize classwork and other responsibilities more than a course not worth a credit, there were some stretches
      where it was really hard to get work done because of poor time management for work outside of SLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing that we practiced and got better at over time was teamwork. For the beginning stages of the project, we had to discuss
      and figure out a project that both of us would be happy doing for the final presentation. As we started working on the project, it took
      communication between us to make sure we got everything done that was needed.
