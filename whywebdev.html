    <h1>Why Web Development?</h1>
    <p>
      One reason why we wanted to explore web development was because both of us were planning on majoring in Computer Science. Web development is different than programming,
      but both of us thought it would be interesting to explore it as it's a little simpler to learn and there are less concepts that you can get stuck on throughout your time
      learning about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why web development was a good choice for us was because we have friends who are experienced in the topic. Whenever we got stuck, there were people we could ask
      for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, web development is just a topic that's really important in today's online society. Being able to make a functional and good-looking website is important for all kinds
      of applications from a personal website to an online resume for your professional achievements and skills.
