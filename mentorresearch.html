    <h1>What research was needed for the project? Did you have a mentor?</h1>
    <p>
      Most of the research we did was at the beginning of the project when we were deciding what method we wanted to use to learn web development.
      The biggest ideas we had were either using an online YouTube series to learn, using an online PDF/book, or an online course. We ended up
      using an online course because a structured learning system would make learning material more organized and easier over the long run.

    <p>
      In terms of mentors, although we didn't technically have someone we met with on a regular basis to teach us, we both had friends who had some experience in web development
      who we could ask to help us whenever necessary.
