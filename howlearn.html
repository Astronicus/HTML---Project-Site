    <h1>How did you learn material for web development</h1>
    <p>
      To learn the material, we used an online course.
      The course we picked was one called "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" made by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.com. The course was very extensive so we weren't able to
      finish all the material in it - we just set a goal for how far we wanted to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      For web development, there are three major elements necessary to make a website that looks nice and has functionality, which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      HTML creates the structure of the website, CSS styles it, and JavaScript gives it functionality. Using an analogy of a house, HTML would be the physical structure,
      CSS would be the stylistic choices that determine what the house looks like, and JavaScript would be the utilities like water and electricity in the house.
      The online course we chose covered all three, but our goal was to get through HTML and CSS to make a website that looked nice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, because we got behind on schedule, most of this website is made with HTML only - there is one page at the bottom that will be made
      with CSS so you can at least see what it looks like.
