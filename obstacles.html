    <h1>What obstacles did you face during the project?</h1>
    <p>
      Our biggest obstacle for the project was definitely time management. With how busy we both were this year between coursework and college applications,
      web development and our SLE project were put off to meet the other things we had to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another smaller obstacle we faced was that the course we were using named "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" actually wasn't completely fully updated,
      meaning that some of the instructions we saw and the packages that were recommended were outdated. This was more of a inconvenience than an obstacle for us,
      but continuing the course, it could become more bothersome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one of us had hardware issues with our laptop which delayed some of the work and learning that could be done.
