    <h1>Do you both intend on continuing to learn web development next year?</h1>
    <p>
      We're both definitely still interested in the topic but we haven't decided if it's what we want to continue exploring in SLE next year.
      We have future goals to make a website that fully utilizes JavaScript and CSS to both look nice while also having some functionality,
      whether it be in the form of an online tool/application or a small browser game.
