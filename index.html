  <h2>What is Student Led Exploration?</h2>
  <p>
    Student Led Exploration <strong>(SLE)</strong> is a class at Zionsville Community High School. The class provides an opportunity for students to research
    and dive deeper into a subject of their own choice that they are interested in. At the beginning of the semester, students are allowed to make plans with
    a coordinator who will help them plan a project to work towards throughout the semester while making goals for progress as time passes. At the end of the
    semester, students make a presentation showcasing their project and what they have learned throughout the time they used to work on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Student Led Exploration is similar to another course offered at ZCHS, Advanced Passion Exploration <strong>(APEX)</strong>. The main difference between APEX
    and SLE is that SLE does not count as a credit and does not have any grades associated with it. On the other hand, APEX is graded like a regular high school course
    with assessments and assignments throughout the semester that contribute to a final grade, counting as a high school credit.

  <h2>What was our project for SLE?</h2>
  <p>
    Our project for SLE was to get an introduction in the field of web development. Web development is the work involved in creating and developing a website for display on the internet.
    The final project we decided to do was to create a website (you're reading it right now!) documenting some of the information about our project and what we learned from it. Below are
    links for more detailed information about our project!
